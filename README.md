# TextWidgetOi

I made a lot of progress in the time between fixing my roadblock and the milestone.
The user must accept both permissions and click the home button. Then drag a widget to the screen and fill out the data fields marked. 
This will put the name of the recipient and the message you want to send them into the shared preferences.
Unfortunately, I have not been able to fix the null pointer exception that I am getting when I try to use a phone number in a similar manner.
However, for the purposes of testing I used the default "5544" number to make sure the message was sending on update and that the "recipient's" name was in the widget.

I plan to move forward on this app when I have time as I would like to fix the obvious issue with the actual phone numbers by around this time next week if possible.

Thanks,

JP Richmond
